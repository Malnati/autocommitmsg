# Auto-Commit-Msg: Your Intelligent Commit Message Assistant

## Description
This repository contains a Bash script designed to analyze the content of a Git commit and automatically suggest a semantic versioning message. It utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo engine to generate the commit message based on the changes staged for commit.

## Overview

Auto-Commit-Msg is a cutting-edge utility designed to streamline your Git commit process. It intelligently analyzes your commit content and suggests semantic versioning messages, making your version control more efficient and meaningful. 

## Features

### IDE Agnostic

One of the standout features of Auto-Commit-Msg is its IDE-agnostic nature. This means you can use it across any Integrated Development Environment (IDE), be it Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse, or any other. 

#### Why is IDE Agnostic Important?

Being IDE agnostic removes the limitations tied to a specific development environment. It offers you the freedom to switch between IDEs without worrying about compatibility issues, thus making it a versatile tool that adapts to your workflow rather than forcing you to adapt to it.

### Project Accelerator

Auto-Commit-Msg serves as an accelerator for your projects. By automating the often tedious task of crafting meaningful commit messages, it allows you to focus more on coding and less on administrative tasks. This speeds up the development process, helping you meet deadlines and achieve milestones more efficiently.

### User and Project-Level Preferences

Tailor the utility to meet your specific needs. Auto-Commit-Msg supports both user and project-level preferences, allowing for a highly customized experience.

### Secure API Key Storage

Your OpenAI API key is encrypted and securely stored, ensuring that your sensitive data is kept safe.

### Multi-Language Support for OpenAI API

Set your preferred language for interacting with the OpenAI API, making it a globally accessible tool.
